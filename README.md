# In-depth Analysis and Prediction of Hotel Demand

## Problem Statement
Our project focuses on leveraging predictive analytics to forecast future booking patterns. By analyzing historical data, we aim to analyze customer patterns and create models that predict booking trends. These insights will empower hotels to make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and tailor services to meet guest expectations. Without these predictive capabilities, hotels risk revenue loss due to misjudged demand or unmet guest needs. Thus, our emphasis on data-driven strategies aims to mitigate these risks and enhance guest satisfaction.

## Project Goal
The projectâ€™s goal is to offer a detailed understanding of booking patterns and behaviors within 2 hotels in Portugal - City Hotel and Resort Hotel. The analysis aims to cover client origins, peak demand days, seasonal pricing variations, booking patterns, and cancellation trends over time. Additionally, based on historical booking information prediction models like linear regression, logistic regression, and kNN will be developed to forecast future potential cancellations.
